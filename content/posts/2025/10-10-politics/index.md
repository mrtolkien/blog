This is going to be a long one.

I often argue with friends, or random online strangers, about politics. I
thought it would be good to write it all down once.

I also want to hold myself accountable if I say stupid shit. The world has the
right to know if future shows I was a moron!

# My values

Before going into specifics and policies, it's important to define what are my
values. Values are things I _believe_ in. Things that are not necessarily
provable, but seem right.

Like everyone, those values are the product of the society I was raised in
(France), my socio-economic capital (middle class with supportive parents), my
ethnicity and sexuality (straight cis white male), and my own political
experience.

You can say I'm your average retit bourgeois.

## Epicureanism

I would consider myself a believer in Epicure's philosophy: I think every human
strives to maximize their pleasure, and that happiness comes from the absence of
fear/stress.

But Epicure always made it clear that the way to achieve it was **moderation**:
you need to learn to be content with little pleasures, and not transform your
pleasure into needs. If you want too much or get used to a luxurious life, you
will be scared to lose it, causing anguish.

Therefore, I strive to imagine social systems that allows people to flourish
under that mindset. I want everyone to be able to live a life of healthy,
reasonnable pleasures, free of stress and anguish.

## Democracy

When taking groups of people, having them think together about solutions to
their problems, and making them com up with compromises, you generally get good
results. This is the core idea behind the democratic ideals of Rousseau.

A great example was the French [Citizens Convention for
Climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_Convention_for_Climate) where
participants were selected by drawing lots, got given time to study and question
experts, and which came up with ambitious, well thought out rules to tackle
climate change.

Those qualities of democracy completely disappear when politics are reduced to
voting for representatives you'll never meet, who are taking decisions that
won't affect them. Of course, this is how all western "democracies" are
structured, and the propositions of the Citizens Convention for Climate were
completely ignored.

I deeply believe in democracy, but _actual_ democracy where ordinary people are
given time, get access to high quality information, and whose voices are
directly listened to.

## Science

I'm a engineer, and I believe in science. [Not necessarily just the western
definition of science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQdTmvqCgxI): I believe
in trying to understand the world around us, and doing our best to formulate
theories or belief systems that explains it.

This means that when there's a scientific consensus on a subject, I learn about
it, get educated, and I take it in as a likely hypothesis.

I will listen to dissenting voices, pay attention to their arguments, but until
there is strong evidence against a consensus, I will continue to believe the
consensus knowledge is likely right.

As a consequence, I do believe that climate change is a real, urgent, and
life-threatening phenomenon. I do believe that trans people exist, and that what
creates the best outcomes for everyone is acceptance and support. I do believe
that immigration has a net positive impact on the economy of host countries. I
also do believe that free trade has _in general_ a positive economic impact.

Many people much smarter than me have spent decades arguing about those points,
and I choose to believe the ones with the most evidence and support.

## The French revolution

To close it out, I think they had it mostly right during the French revolution.
I agree with Rousseau, Danton, Robespierre, and Marat on the points where they converged.

Direct democracy was one of them.

"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or death", was another.

### Liberty

Everyone says they support freedom, but defining it is particularly hard.

If you are forced to work a job you despise to survive, are you really free?

Does freedom include the freedom to harass and demonize others? Freedom to kill
others directly? Freedom to kill others indirectly, for example through mass
pollution?

For me, liberty is a goal, a metric we should maximize. In itself, it holds no
meaning. It is only understandable in the lights of the other values of the
motto.

### Equality

I have a deeply rooted belief that all human beings deserve to be treated
equally.

There is not really a rational behind it: it's a value I hold as I do not
believe in intrinsic hierarchies between human beings.

Equality also ties with my belief in democracy: if you do not strive for
equality, some voices will be drowned out. And losing any voice in society
weakens democracy.

### Fraternity

For me, fraternity is about good faith. It's about believing in the potential of
every human. It's about being ethical and treating others as we want to be
treated.

Without it, there can be no equals, so it might be a bit redundant with
equality. But I believe in it.

### Or death

And yes. Part of my belief is that those values are worth fighting for. I think
existing systems hold tremendous power, and toppling them to improve society
might include extreme social unrest.

I sincerely hope it will not get to violence, but the dominant forces are
generally pretty closed to the idea of radically rethinking the power dynamics.
