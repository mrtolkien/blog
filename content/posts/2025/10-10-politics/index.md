This is going to be a long one.

I often argue with friends and random online strangers about politics. I
thought it would be good to write it all down once.

I also want to hold myself accountable if I say stupid shit. The world has the
right to know if future shows I was a moron!

# My values

Before going into specifics and policies, it's important to define what are my
values. Values are things I _believe_ in. Things that are not necessarily
provable, but seem right.

Like everyone, those values are the product of the society I was raised in
(France), my socio-economic capital (middle class with supportive parents), my
ethnicity and sexuality (straight cis white male), and my own political
experience (having in Japan for 10 years).

I'm also autistic at the lightest possible level: I mostly am passing as a
neurotypical person, except when talking about any of my special interests,
including politics.

You can say I'm your average petit bourgeois.

## Epicureanism

I would consider myself a believer in Epicure's philosophy: I think every human
strives to maximize their pleasure, and that happiness comes from the absence of
fear and stress.

But Epicure always made it clear that the way to achieve it was **moderation**:
you need to learn to be content with small pleasures, and not to transform your
pleasure into needs. If you want too much or get used to a luxurious life, you
will be scared to lose it, causing anguish.

Therefore, I strive to imagine social systems that allows people to flourish
under that mindset. I want everyone to be able to live a life of healthy,
reasonnable pleasures, free of stress and anguish.

## Democracy

When taking groups of people, having them think together about solutions to
their problems, and making them come up with compromises, you generally get good
results. This is the core idea behind the democratic ideals of Rousseau.

A great example was the French [Citizens Convention for
Climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_Convention_for_Climate) where
participants were selected by drawing lots and got given time to study and question
experts. They came up with ambitious, well thought out rules to tackle
climate change.

Those qualities of democracy completely disappear when "democracy" is reduced to
voting for representatives you'll never meet, who are taking decisions that
will never affect them. Of course, this is how all western "democracies" are
structured, and the propositions of the Citizens Convention for Climate were
completely ignored.

I deeply believe in democracy, but _actual_ democracy where ordinary people get
access to high quality information, can form informed propositions, and whose
voices are actually listened to.

## Science

I'm a engineer, and I believe in science. [Not necessarily just the western
definition of science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQdTmvqCgxI): I believe
in trying to understand the world around us, and doing our best to formulate
theories or belief systems that explain it.

This means that when there's a scientific consensus on a subject, I learn about
it, get educated, and I take it in as a likely hypothesis.

I will listen to dissenting voices, pay attention to their arguments, but until
there is strong evidence against a consensus, I will continue to believe the
consensus knowledge is likely right.

As a consequence, I do believe that climate change is a real, urgent, and
life-threatening phenomenon. I do believe that trans people exist, and that what
creates the best outcomes for everyone is acceptance and support. I do believe
that immigration has a net positive impact on the economy of host countries. I
also do believe that free trade has _in general_ a positive economic impact.

Many people much smarter than me have spent decades arguing about those points,
and I choose to believe the ones with the most evidence and support.

## The French revolution

To close it out, I think they had it mostly right during the French revolution.
Might be because I'm French, but the more I learn about this period, the more
I'm amazed at how much we got wrong afterwards.

I agree with Rousseau, Danton, Robespierre, and Marat on the points where they
converged.

Direct democracy was one of them.

"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or death", was another.

### Liberty

Everyone says they support freedom, but defining it is particularly hard.

If you are **forced** to work a job you despise to survive, are you really free?

Does freedom include the freedom to harass and demonize others? Freedom to kill
others directly? Freedom to kill others indirectly, for example through mass
pollution?

For me, liberty is a goal, a metric we should maximize while taking into account
the other constraints. In itself, it holds no meaning. It is only understandable
in the lights of the other values we hold.

### Equality

I have a deeply rooted belief that all human beings deserve to be treated
equally.

There is not really a rational behind it: it's a value I hold as I do not
believe in intrinsic hierarchies between human beings.

Equality also ties with my belief in democracy: if you do not strive for
equality, many voices will be drowned out. And losing any voice in society
weakens democracy.

### Fraternity

For me, fraternity is about good faith. It's about believing in the potential of
every human. It's about being ethical and treating others the way we want to be
treated.

Without it, there can be no equals, so it might be a bit redundant with
equality. But I believe in it.

### Or death

And yes. Part of my belief is that those values are worth fighting for. I think
existing systems hold tremendous power, and toppling them to improve society
might include social unrest.

I sincerely hope it will not get to violence, but dominant forces are generally
pretty closed to the idea of radically rethinking existing power dynamics.

# What matters

## Power

Something it took me way too long to realize was the deep interconnexion between
different forms of power: economic power, political power, cultural power,
military power, ...

Until I hit my 30s, I always thought western democracies would be able to stop
overwhelming economic power turing into overwhelming political power.

I was wrong.

Billionaires have been buying media for decades, including social media,
specifically to acquire political power. And existing laws are woefully outdated
for the internet and AI age.

As this concentration of power has been speeding up, I realized that to me it
was the core issue: **concentration of power** goes against all the values I
outlined above.

If a single person holds outsized power, how can there be democracy? Equality?
Fraternity?

Therefore, one of the key goals with any policy I support is the reduction of
concentration of _any form_ of power. I'll get into the specifics below.

## Ecology

Another core goal that comes from my values is that the biggest threat to
humanity and worldwide peace is climate change.

There is widespread consensus on the subject, and every new piece of evidence we
get solidifies this hypothesis.

Every single public policy should therefore have its ecological impact in
mind.

## Decolonialism, anti-racism, feminism

Equality is a core value for me, and it does not stop at the borders of the
countries I live in.

As I:

- believe in equality
- want the reduction of the concentration of power
- want actual democracy

It only makes sense that I'm deeply decolonial, as colonialism is:

- instutionalized inequality
- concentration of power in the controlling country
- stealing of democratic rights of existing populations

In the exact same way, I would call myself anti-racist and feminist.

All discrimation systems exist to push back against equality and fraternity, and
to concentrate power in the existing ruling class. Everything that I despise.

# What doesn't matter

In all rich countries there's a massive rise of far rights and nationalists,
gaining popularity by blaming everything on "the other".

It can be northern african immigration (France), middle american immigration
(USA), chinese nationals (Japan), the LGBT community (Hungary), muslims
(Germany), feminists (Korea)... Really, anything goes.

Then, when in power, however much discrimination they put in place, the lives of
their citizens doesn't improve.

It's because it does not matter.

The issue is that it's an extremely good strategy to garner votes in
"democracies". By creating a wedge issue around an extremely simplistic topic,
you channel the discussion around your moronic talking points.

And since most people don't care that much about politics, you'll get many votes
of people simply dissatisfied with their current life situation as you just gave
them a very simple and appealing solution: there is no need for systemic change,
there is no need for economic reform, there is no need to change anything in
your life. Just kick "the other" out of society, and all your problems will be
solved.

But once again, since it literally does not matter, the only solution those
politicians have, once they fail at creating positive change, is to create more
imaginary ennemies and go deeper and deeper into repression, until reaching a
fascist state in which no-one is ever pure enough.

Currently that's examplified extremely well in the US. I sincerly feel bad for
most Trump voters who have legitimate concerns about their lives going to shit
after production has been delocalized abroad and no actual alternative proposed
by their successive failing governments.

So at some point, they just voted for the one guy who told them he had a
solution. They got scammed, but I sincerly do not think it is their individual
faults.
