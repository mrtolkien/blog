This is going to be a long one.

I often argue with friends and random strangers online about politics. I
thought it would be good to write it all down once.

I also want to hold myself accountable if I say stupid shit. The world has the
right to know if the future shows I was a moron!

## My values

Before going into specifics and policies, it's important to define what are my
values. Values are things I _believe_ in. Things that are not necessarily
provable, but seem right.

Like everyone, those values are the product of the society I was raised in
(France), my socio-economic capital (middle class with supportive parents), my
ethnicity and sexuality (straight cis white male), and my own political
experience (having lived in Japan for 10 years).

I'm also autistic at the lightest possible level: I mostly am passing as a
neurotypical person, except when talking about any of my special interests,
including politics.

You can say I'm your average petit bourgeois.

### Epicureanism

I would consider myself a believer in Epicure's philosophy: I think every human
strives to maximize their pleasure, and that happiness comes from the absence
of fear and stress.

But Epicure always made it clear that the way to achieve it was **moderation**:
you need to learn to be content with small pleasures, and not to transform your
pleasure into needs. If you want too much or get used to a luxurious life, you
will be scared to lose it, causing anguish.

Therefore, I strive to imagine social systems that allows people to flourish
under that mindset. I want everyone to be able to live a life of healthy,
reasonable pleasures, free of stress and anguish.

### Democracy

When taking groups of people, having them think together about solutions to
their problems, and making them come up with compromises, you generally get
good results. This is the core idea behind the democratic ideals of
Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

A great example was the French [Citizens Convention for
Climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_Convention_for_Climate) where
participants were selected by drawing lots and got given time to study and
question experts. They came up with ambitious, well thought out rules to tackle
climate change.

Those qualities of democracy completely disappear when "democracy" is reduced
to voting for representatives you'll never meet, who are taking decisions that
will never affect them. Of course, this is how all western "democracies" are
structured, and the propositions of the Citizens Convention for Climate were
completely ignored.

I deeply believe in democracy, but _actual_ democracy where ordinary people get
access to high quality information, can form informed opinions, and whose
voices are actually listened to.

### Science

I'm a engineer, and I believe in science. [Not necessarily just the western
definition of science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQdTmvqCgxI): I believe
in trying to understand the world around us, and doing our best to formulate
theories or belief systems that explains it.

This means that when there's a scientific consensus on a subject, I learn about
it, get educated, and I take it in as a likely hypothesis.

I will listen to dissenting voices, pay attention to their arguments, but until
there is strong evidence against a consensus, I will continue to believe that
the consensus knowledge is likely right.

As a consequence, I do believe that climate change is a real, urgent, and
life-threatening phenomenon. I do believe that trans people exist, and that
what creates the best outcomes for everyone is acceptance and support. I do
believe that immigration has a net positive impact on the economy of host
countries. I also believe that free trade has _in general_ a positive economic
impact.

Many people much smarter than me have spent decades arguing about those points,
and I choose to believe the ones with the most evidence and support.

Some might say this might clash with democracy: what if the people want something
that goes against the scientific consensus?

I simply believe it is not something that would come up regularly in a proper
democracy, as shown by previous examples.

### The French revolution

To close it out, I think they had it mostly right during the French revolution.
Might be because I'm French, but the more I learn about this period, the more
I'm amazed at how much we got wrong afterwards.

I agree with Rousseau, Danton, Robespierre, and Marat on the points where they
converged.

Direct democracy was one of them.

"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or death", was another.

#### Liberty

Everyone says they support freedom, but defining it is particularly hard.

If you are **forced** to work a job you despise to survive, are you really
free?

Does freedom include the freedom to harass and demonize others? Freedom to kill
others directly? Freedom to kill others indirectly, for example through mass
pollution?

For me, liberty is a goal, a metric we should maximize while taking into
account the other constraints. In itself, it holds no meaning. It is only
understandable in the lights of the other values we hold.

#### Equality

I have a deeply rooted belief that all human beings deserve to be treated
equally.

There is not really a rational behind it: it's a value I hold as I do not
believe in intrinsic hierarchies between human beings.

Equality also ties with my belief in democracy: if you do not strive for
equality, many voices will be drowned out. And losing any voice in society
weakens democracy.

#### Fraternity

For me, fraternity is about good faith. It's about believing in the potential
of every human. It's about being ethical and treating others the way we want to
be treated.

Without it, there can be no equals, so it might be a bit redundant with
equality. But I believe in it.

#### Or death

Part of my belief is that those values are worth fighting for. I'm an
Epicurean, but I does not mean everyone has to be one. I think existing systems
hold tremendous power, and toppling them to improve society might include
social unrest.

I sincerely hope it will not get to violence, but dominant forces are generally
pretty closed to the idea of radically rethinking existing power dynamics.

## What matters

### Power

Something it took me way too long to realize was the deep interconnection
between different forms of power: economic power, political power, cultural
power, military power, ...

Until I hit my 30s, I always thought western democracies would be able to stop
overwhelming economic power turning into overwhelming political power.

I was wrong.

Billionaires have been buying media for decades, including social media,
specifically to acquire political power. And existing laws are woefully
outdated for the internet and AI age.

As this concentration of power has been speeding up, I realized that, to me, it
was the core issue: **concentration of power** goes against all the values I
outlined above.

If a single person holds outsized power, how can there be democracy? Equality?
Fraternity?

Therefore, one of the key goals with any policy I support is the reduction of
concentration of _any form_ of power. I'll get into the specifics below.

### Ecology

Another core goal that comes from my values is that the biggest threat to
humanity and worldwide peace is climate change.

There is widespread scientific consensus on the subject, and every new piece of
evidence we get solidifies this hypothesis.

Every single public policy should therefore have its ecological impact in mind.

### Decolonialism, anti-racism, feminism

Equality is a core value for me, and it does not stop at the borders of the
countries I live in.

As I:

- believe in equality
- want the reduction of the concentration of power
- want actual democracy

It only makes sense that I'm deeply decolonial, as colonialism is:

- institutionalized inequality
- concentration of power in the controlling country
- stealing of democratic rights of existing populations

In the exact same way, I would call myself anti-racist and feminist.

All discrimination systems exist to push back against equality and fraternity,
and to concentrate power in the existing ruling class. Everything that I
despise.

## What doesn't matter

In all rich countries there's a massive rise of far rights and nationalists,
gaining popularity by blaming everything on "the other".

It can be northern African immigration (France), middle American immigration
(USA), Chinese nationals (Japan), the LGBT community (Hungary), Muslims
(Germany), feminists (Korea)... Really, anything goes.

Then, when in power, however much discrimination they put in place, the lives
of their citizens doesn't improve.

It's because it does not matter. The weight of recent evidence is overwhelming:

- Card (2005) - "Is the New Immigration Really So Bad"
- Card (2009) - "Immigration and Inequality"
- Peri (2012) - "The Effect of Immigration on Productivity: Evidence from U.S.
  States"
- Ottaviano & Peri (2012) - "Rethinking the Effect of Immigration on Wages"
- Caiumi & Peri (2024) - Immigration's Effect on US Wages and Employment Redux
  - Found immigration had a positive effect between +1.7 to +2.6% on wages of
    less educated native workers over 2000-2019

The issue is that it's an extremely good strategy to garner votes in
"democracies". By creating a wedge issue around an extremely simplistic topic,
you channel the discussion around your moronic talking points.

And since most people don't care that much about politics, you'll get many
votes of people simply dissatisfied with their current life situation as you
just gave them a very simple and appealing solution: there is no need for
systemic change, there is no need for economic reform, there is no need to
change anything in your life. Just kick "the other" out of society, and all
your problems will be solved.

But once again, since it literally does not matter, the only solution those
politicians have, once they fail at creating positive change, is to create more
imaginary enemies and go deeper and deeper into repression, until reaching a
fascist state in which no-one is ever pure enough.

Currently that's exemplified extremely well in the US. I sincerely feel bad for
most Trump voters who have legitimate concerns about their lives going to shit
after production has been delocalized abroad and no actual alternative proposed
by their successive failing governments.

So at some point, they just voted for the one guy who told them he had a
solution. They got scammed, but I sincerely do not think it is their individual
faults.

## Economic policies

So let's get in the weeds a bit and talk about policies.

The core ones are the economic policies, as they shape the material life
conditions of the citizens.

### Taxing wealth above work

You probably heard that one before, either from Piketty, Zucman, or Gary's
Economics: "Tax Wealth Not Work"

Many modern economists think that the concentration of wealth is a core issue
for our economies, partly because they reduce the spending power of the middle
class.

The tax outlined by Zucman proposes to tax wealthy individuals owning over
1,000,00000 (100 millions) euros by 2% of their wealth yearly. No loophole, no
shortcuts.

Doing so would put their taxation in line with what top earners pay. Their
wealth would still be increasing even without any form of work.

Let's be entirely honest: this is not enough, and the fact that it is being
fought so vehemently is a very good example of how deep our economies have been
cannibalized by billionaires.

I'm not going to offer specifics, but guidelines and goals

- Our taxes systems should be _vastly simpler_ than they are right now
  - Less loopholes and simpler declarations
  - Fairer taxation for those who can't afford a tax accountant
- All taxes should be progressive: wealthier individuals should pay more as a
  percent of their wealth and income than poorer individuals
  - This is not the case right now mostly because of VAT
  - VAT should be a luxury tax, only applied to non-essential goods
- Wealth accumulation should be fought when it's grossly over what's needed for
  a luxurious life, as we are all bidding for the same assets
- Our systems need to stop being hyper-focused on 1-year fiscal periods
  - This ties into making taxes simpler and reducing opportunities for
    optimization
  - A wealth tax for example is not particularly focused on a specific fiscal
    period, it could be a monthly 0.2% wealth tax

### The issue of private companies

One of the biggest issue with the current economic system is the corporate
structure.

Private companies worldwide today serves multiple purposes:

- Remove social and legal responsibility from CEOs, who become empowered to do
  _anything_ for short-term profit under their direction
- Give direct access to the company's money for lobbying
- Hide assets ownership away from state taxation with complex fiscal montages

While private companies don't _directly_ allows this, the fact that every
country recognizes foreign companies as legitimate has that effect.

But it just does not work. Recognizing companies created in fiscal havens as
legitimate just lets companies escape taxation.

Another issue is that the money from those companies is then weaponized for
political impact.

My solution would be to:

- Clearly outlaw lobbying: any use of company resources used to influence
  public policies should be punished harshly
  - Companies should be allowed to suggest policies for consideration by
    parliaments, and _that's it_
- Push for worker's ownership of companies through strong fiscal incentives
  - Taxes for workers owned companies should be lowered as much as possible, as
    long as the ownership is fairly shared and all employees have voting rights
- Add a legally binding social responsibility clause to companies, including
  worker's well-being, quality of life, social impact, ...
- Limit limited liability: shareholders and CEOs should be held _directly_
  responsible for mismanaging companies

### Free trade

Believe it or not, I'm in favor of trade being as free as possible when
accounting for the constraints above.

Trade is mutually beneficial for countries and populations. It creates wealth
by allowing for specialization.

But it can't just be done willy nilly.

You can't trade with companies who don't play by the same rules. You can't
trade with countries actively destroying our planet.

Ideally, you should not trade with dangerous imperialist powers threatening
world peace with constant aggression out of their borders.

So I'm for free trade with other true democracies, of which there are none
today. A bit of a cop out, I know.

But I also believe this is the course of history, and that there will be
trade partners willing to play by those rules. Trade partners willing to
fight concentration of power. Trade partners willing to keep our planet
livable for the future generations.

### Public investment means public ownership

This one sounds obvious to me, but somehow it is not.

If the state gives money to a company without buying a product from it, it
should get some form of ownership of it.

This means tax rebates should require company stocks for the state in exchange.

It's such common sense that what's crazy is that it's not the case yet.

## Digital policies

Another hard one is digital policies. We need clear and useful regulation for
mega platforms like Twitter, TikTok, Insta, Youtube, ... We can't let American
billionaires decide what's right for us.

## Social policies

### Cars
